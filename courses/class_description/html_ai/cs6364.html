Fascinated by artificial intelligence? Curious to find out how robots work? Want to know more about intelligent agents? The graduate Computer Science class 6364 on Artificial Intelligence answers these questions and addresses key information about the practices and theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence. This course will introduce students to the principles of artificial intelligence systems, to methods of building intelligent systems of various complexity.

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of artificial (computer-based) systems capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior. CS 6364 focuses on the symbolic approach to AI, in which problems are solved through reasoning about, and searching over, symbolic representations of the world. The course is organized around a conceptualization of what an entire intelligent system might look like; that is, around the notion of an "intelligent agent".

<p>This one-semester course provides a strong grounding in the fundamentals of AI in the context of an intelligent agent. It should be of value both to students who want only one semester of background in AI and to students who want to pursue AI further. For the latter students, more one-semester courses are offered in the Intelligent Systems track. Such courses comprise Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision and Knowledge Processing.

<p>In CS 6364, we begin by introducing AI and the concept of an agent. Although CS 6364 is not a programming course per se -- the focus is more on concepts than on programming skill -- experience in using languages like Lisp will be an important part of the course. We then proceed to examine, in the context of intelligent agents, the core concepts underlying symbolic artificial intelligence: search, representation, and reasoning. This will include a significant amount of material on logic, which forms the basis for much of the existing work on representation and reasoning, as well as a smattering of more applied topics (such as game playing).

<li> Interested in learning how to build computational methods for interpreting texts? </li>
<li> Do you want to learn how Large Language Models operate? </li>
<li> Fascinated with neural language processing, which is able to process with great accuracy texts from any language? </li>
<li> Do you want to learn why natural language is ambiguous and to discover how ambiguity can be resolved? </li>

The undergraduate Computer Science class CS 4396 on Human Language Technology  addresses key information about
the linguistic foundations and algorithmic practices that enable language modeling 
lexical disambiguation, syntactic parsing,  semantic interpretation and even semantic disambiguation of texts. 

<p><font color="IndianRed">Natural Language Processing (NLP), on which Human Language Technologues are based, is the oldest discipline 
in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the study of 
how language is used in written texts, verbal dialogues, allowing us to understand each other. The focus in NLP is creating computational
models that can be implemented for automatic processing of natural language.

<p><font color="RoyalBlue"> CS 4395 focuses on the basic HLT techniques, including language modeling, syntactic parsing, 
semantic interpretation and disambiguation, lexical analysis, affect processing as well as several HLT applications. 
This course is also providing extensive examples of using Deep Learning for language processing. 
Students will learn how to evaluate in a scientific way the language techniques they learn and will become familiar with widely available language processing resources. 
Students will also become familiar with language annotations.

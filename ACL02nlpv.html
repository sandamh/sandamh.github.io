<p>This exploratory workshop will focus on leveraging visualization and natural language processing technologies to
improve both fields. Participants are expected to be experienced in NLP but not necessarily experienced in visualization
techniques. A brief summary of visualization techniques will be provided. The workshop will be highly participatory.
Participants will form small groups and explore challenge problems, discuss alternatives, and present results to the
workshop. The workshop will also include a brainstorming session about new visualization possibilities utilizing NLP
and a discussion of the potential effects of NLP and Visualization on each other.

<p>Interested participants should submit brief descriptions of:</p>

<ul>
<li> the intended users and usage for their research</li>
